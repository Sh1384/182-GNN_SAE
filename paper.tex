\begin{abstract}
Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) represent the computational substrate of life, orchestrating how genes regulate each other through motifs such as feedforward and feedback loops. Despite the success of graph neural networks (GNNs) in modeling biological interactions, their internal reasoning remains opaque. This project proposes to combine GNNs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to understand whether GNNs trained to predict gene expression learn biologically meaningful regulatory motifs. The GNN will be trained on synthetic graphs to impute missing expression (i.e., output) values, and its hidden activations will be frozen and decomposed via SAEs. We will analyze whether individual SAE features correspond to canonical motifs using correlation and causal ablation tests. This study aims to provide a foundation for mechanistic interpretability in graph-based models for different graph-like motifs, something invaluable to biology.

\section{Introduction and Background}

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are the decision-making circuits of cellular life. These directed networks encode the causal logic—such as feedforward loops, feedback cycles, and cascades—that governs gene expression and cellular differentiation. In recent years, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the dominant paradigm for modeling such relational data. The mathematical foundation for efficient learning on graph structures was formalized by \citet{kipf2017} with the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), which enables models to aggregate local neighborhood information effectively. \citet{fout2017} demonstrated the power of these architectures in computational biology, specifically for protein interface prediction, proving that GNNs can learn complex, biologically relevant spatial relationships.

Since these foundational works, GNNs have been applied to increasingly complex biological problems. \citet{zitnik2018} utilized GNNs to model polypharmacy side effects, capturing higher-order interactions between drugs and protein targets that simple pairwise models missed. To address the heterogeneity of biological graphs, \citet{velickovic2018} introduced Graph Attention Networks (GATs), which allow nodes to learn dynamic weighting schemes for their neighbors, potentially improving model expressivity on irregular regulatory networks. However, as the predictive power of these models has grown, so has their opacity. While GNNs can predict molecular outcomes with high accuracy, understanding \textit{how} they reason about the underlying topology remains a significant challenge. \citet{dwivedi2022} highlighted this gap, proposing standardized benchmarks for GNN interpretability, yet most existing methods rely on post-hoc feature importance measures rather than decomposing the model's internal representations.

Parallel to these developments in graph learning, the field of mechanistic interpretability has made strides in deciphering the internal states of Large Language Models (LLMs). \citet{bricken2023} provided a theoretical framework for "monosemanticity," arguing that neural networks often encode multiple concepts in single neurons (polysemanticity), which obscures interpretation. They proposed dictionary learning via Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) as a method to disentangle these superimposed concepts into sparse, interpretable features. \citet{cunningham2023} successfully applied this technique to finding highly interpretable features in language models, effectively "opening the black box" of transformer activations. More recently, \citet{templeton2024} demonstrated that this approach scales to massive frontier models like Claude 3 Sonnet, extracting millions of interpretable features that abstract away from individual neurons.

The intersection of these fields—GNNs for biology and SAE-based interpretability—remains largely unexplored. A notable exception is the recent work by \citet{garcia2025}, who applied sparse autoencoders to Protein Language Models, identifying interpretable structural and functional features within sequence-based representations. However, biology is not just about sequences; it is fundamentally about \textit{networks}. To date, no systematic study has applied SAEs to understand how GNNs internalize the discrete regulatory motifs that define GRNs. This project bridges this gap. By training GNNs on simulated GRNs with ground-truth motif structures and analyzing their activations via SAEs, we aim to determine if the "computational primitives" learned by the GNN align with the "biological primitives" (motifs) known to science.

\section{Methodology}

The methodology implemented in this study follows a comprehensive multi-stage pipeline designed to rigorously evaluate the interpretability of graph neural networks. The process begins with the generation of synthetic, motif-annotated graphs, proceeds to the training of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for node-level imputation, involves the learning of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) on frozen intermediate activations, and concludes with a statistical evaluation of interpretability through motif correlation and causal ablation.

\subsection{Virtual Data Construction and Simulation}

The foundation of our dataset is a collection of 5,000 directed weighted graphs generated via a custom stochastic block model framework. These graphs are stored as pickled NetworkX objects, with filenames encoding their underlying structural logic. Specifically, graph IDs are partitioned by motif type: IDs 0–999 represent feedforward loops, 1000–1999 represent feedback loops, 2000–2999 represent single input modules (SIM), 3000–3999 represent linear cascades, and 4000–4999 represent mixed-motif graphs containing combinations of the former. 

We simulated node-level "expression" dynamics on each graph. For a given graph with weighted adjacency matrix $W$, node states $x$ were initialized uniformly in the range $[0, 1]$. We evolved these states over 50 discrete time steps using a noisy, leaky dynamical system defined by the update rule:
\begin{equation}
x_{t+1} = (1 - \gamma) x_t + \gamma \sigma(W x_t) + \epsilon_t
\end{equation}
Here, the leak rate $\gamma$ was set to 0.3, and $\sigma$ represents a sigmoid nonlinearity clipped to a finite range to prevent numerical instability. The noise term $\epsilon_t$ was drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 0.01. After each update, node states were clipped to $[0, 1]$. The final state vector at $t=50$ was treated as the ground truth expression $y$. 

To validate the simulation duration, we analyzed expression dynamics across all motifs. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:motifs}, different topologies exhibit distinct convergence characteristics.

\subsection{Graph Neural Network Training}

The prediction task was framed as an inductive imputation problem. For each graph, nodes were randomly masked with a probability of $p=0.2$. The input features provided to the GNN consisted of two channels per node: the first channel contained the expression value (set to zero if masked, and otherwise normalized by the maximum expression in the graph), and the second channel was a binary indicator variable (1 if observed, 0 if masked).

The training process utilized a standard 80/10/10 split (Train/Validation/Test) for the graphs. To prevent overfitting, we employed an early stopping mechanism with a patience of 25 epochs. Hyperparameter optimization was conducted via a distributed, multi-GPU sweep using the Optuna framework, searching over hidden dimensions, dropout rates, and learning rates.

\subsubsection{Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)}

The primary architecture evaluated was a three-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). To handle the directed, weighted nature of the regulatory interactions without imposing incorrect assumptions about graph laplacians, we employed graph convolutions without symmetric normalization. For a layer $l$ with input node features $H^{(l)}$ and weighted adjacency $A$, the propagation rule is given by:
\begin{equation}
H^{(l+1)} = \text{ReLU}\left(\text{Dropout}\left(A H^{(l)} W^{(l)} + b^{(l)}\right)\right)
\end{equation}
where $W^{(l)}$ and $b^{(l)}$ are the learnable weight matrix and bias vector. The network maps dimensions $2 \to 248 \to 64 \to 1$. The 64-dimensional bottleneck $H^{(2)}$ serves as the embedding space for the SAE analysis. The objective function was the Mean Squared Error (MSE) computed strictly on the set of masked nodes $\mathcal{M}$:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{GNN}} = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{M}|} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{M}} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Graph Attention Network (GAT)}
We also trained a three-layer Graph Attention Network (GAT) with the same reconstruction objective. Unlike the GCN, which relies on fixed adjacency multiplications, the GAT assigns learnable importance weights to each incoming edge. For layer $l$, with $K_l$ attention heads, the propagation rule is

\begin{equation}
H^{(l+1)}_i = \operatorname{ELU}\Bigg(\bigg\Vert_{k=1}^{K_l} 
\sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} \alpha_{ij}^{(l,k)} W^{(l,k)} H^{(l)}_j\Bigg),
\end{equation}

where the attention coefficients
\[
\alpha_{ij}^{(l,k)} = \operatorname{softmax}_j 
\left(\operatorname{LeakyReLU}\left(a^{(l,k)\top}
\left[W^{(l,k)} H^{(l)}_i \,\Vert\, W^{(l,k)} H^{(l)}_j \,\Vert\, e_{ij}\right]\right)\right)
\]
depend on the learned vector $a^{(l,k)}$ and the explicit edge feature $e_{ij}$ (the original interaction weight). To align with the SAE analysis, the network uses the dimension flow
$2 \rightarrow 64 \rightarrow 64 \rightarrow 1$: the first layer has 2 heads of size 32, the second layer fixes 8 heads of size 8 (yielding the 64-dimensional representation consumed by the SAE), and the final layer is a single-head attention that produces scalar predictions. Dropout of $0.0$ is applied after each attention block. The loss mirrors the GCN case, namely Mean Squared Error over the masked node set $\mathcal{M}$, and the model is trained for 200 epochs with patience set to 25 so that the full schedule is executed.

\subsubsection{Hyperparameter Optimization via Optuna}

To ensure optimal model performance and facilitate fair comparison across architectures, we conducted systematic hyperparameter optimization using the Optuna framework \cite{akiba2019optuna}. Optuna employs a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) sampling algorithm, which models the conditional distribution of hyperparameters given the objective value and iteratively samples from regions of the hyperparameter space that are likely to yield improved performance.

The optimization was performed independently for each architecture (GCN and GAT) to account for architecture-specific optimal configurations. For each trial, the objective function was defined as the validation loss after training for a maximum of 100 epochs with early stopping (patience = 25). The search space encompassed the following hyperparameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Learning rate}: Log-uniform distribution in the range $[10^{-5}, 10^{-1}]$
    \item \textbf{Hidden dimensions}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item GCN Layer 1: $\{8,128\}$ with a step of 8
        \item GAT heads per layer: $\{2, 4, 6, 8\}$ for layer 1, fixed at 8 for layer 2
        \item GAT channels per head: $\{8,128\}$ with a step of 8 for layer 1, fixed at 8 for layer 2
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Dropout rate}: Uniform distribution in $[0.0, 0.5]$
    \item \textbf{Batch size}: Fixed at 128
\end{itemize}

Each hyperparameter optimization study consisted of 50 trials. The best-performing configuration was selected based on the minimum validation loss achieved across all trials. To ensure reproducibility, all trials within a single study used the same data split (seed = 42), isolating the effect of hyperparameters from data variability.

\subsubsection{Baseline Models for Comparative Evaluation}

To establish the value of graph-structured learning and validate that the GNN architectures capture motif-specific patterns beyond simple feature-based prediction, we implemented one baseline model with varying levels of complexity:

\paragraph{MLP Baseline (Feature-Only Learning)}
To isolate the contribution of graph structure, we implemented a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that operates exclusively on node features without access to the graph topology. The MLP architecture mirrors the depth of the GNN models: $2 \to 128 \to 64 \to 1$, with ReLU activations and dropout (0.2) applied after each hidden layer. The input consists of the same two-channel node features used by the GNNs: normalized expression and mask indicator.

\subsubsection{Statistical Evaluation of Baseline Performance}

  To rigorously quantify the performance differences between GNN models and baselines, we employ a multi-seed statistical framework that addresses
  reproducibility concerns common in machine learning research. Each model (GCN, GAT, MLP, Mean baseline) is trained independently across $N=5$ random
  seeds, with each seed controlling weight initialization, data shuffling, and node masking patterns. For each seed $s \in \{0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19\}$, we record the     
   test set MSE computed exclusively on masked nodes.

  \paragraph{Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test.}
  For each comparison, we apply the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, a non-parametric paired test that makes no assumptions about the distribution of performance      
  differences. The test operates on the paired differences $\delta_s = \text{MSE}_s^{(A)} - \text{MSE}_s^{(B)}$ for models $A$ and $B$ trained with the same    
   seed $s$. The null hypothesis $H_0$ is that the median difference is zero (i.e., the two models perform equivalently). We reject $H_0$ at significance        
  level $\alpha = 0.05$ if the two-tailed p-value falls below this threshold.

  \paragraph{Effect Size Quantification.}
  Statistical significance alone does not indicate practical importance. To quantify the magnitude of performance differences, we compute the rank-biserial      
  correlation coefficient $r_{rb}$, which is defined as:
  \begin{equation}
  r_{rb} = 1 - \frac{2U}{n_1 n_2}
  \end{equation}
  where $U$ is the Mann-Whitney U statistic (equivalent to the Wilcoxon statistic for paired data after appropriate transformation), and $n_1 = n_2 = 5$ is      
  the number of seeds. The coefficient $r_{rb} \in [-1, 1]$ measures the effect size, with the following interpretation:
  \begin{itemize}
      \item $|r_{rb}| < 0.1$: Negligible effect
      \item $0.1 \leq |r_{rb}| < 0.3$: Small effect
      \item $0.3 \leq |r_{rb}| < 0.5$: Medium effect
      \item $|r_{rb}| \geq 0.5$: Large effect
  \end{itemize}

  \paragraph{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals.}
  To quantify uncertainty in the effect size estimates, we generate bootstrap confidence intervals via resampling with replacement. For each pairwise
  comparison, we draw 10,000 bootstrap samples from the original five performance measurements per model, recompute the effect size for each bootstrap
  sample, and report the 95\% confidence interval as the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap distribution. Narrow confidence intervals indicate        
  precise effect estimates, while wide intervals suggest high variability.

  This statistical framework allows us to make robust claims about model superiority beyond single-run anecdotal evidence, addressing recent calls for
  reproducibility and statistical rigor in deep learning benchmarks.

\subsection{Fixed Hyperparameter Choices}
\label{sec:hyperparams}

In this section, we report the fixed hyperparameters used for all experiments and provide concise motivations tied to prior literature. Where possible we adopt values recommended by canonical GNN and masked-autoencoder and sparse-autoencoder studies to ensure reproducibility and fair model comparison.

\paragraph{Batch size.} We train all models with \texttt{batch\_size = 128}. This is consistent with prior large-scale GNN representation studies that report stable optimization dynamics in the range $\{64,128\}$ for mini-batch training. In particular, the MISATO framework for probing mechanistic interpretability in GNNs \cite{misato2024} performs all SAE-based circuit extraction experiments using batch sizes between 64 and 128 for both pretraining and probing phases, noting that (i) these batch sizes yield low-variance gradient estimates that preserve feature-level structure in the learned representations, and (ii) larger batches reduce stochasticity that otherwise obscures motif-level attribution. MISATO further reports that increasing the batch size beyond 128 provides no measurable improvement in reconstruction or interpretability metrics, whereas smaller batches increase variance in SAE feature discovery. Following this guidance, we adopt 128 as a stable, memory-efficient setting that ensures comparability with recent interpretability work while maintaining efficient GPU utilization.

\paragraph{Model widths and second-layer size.} To make activations comparable between architectures we use a second-layer output dimension of 64 for all models (GCN, GAT) and for the SAE analysis. For GAT this matches the original architecture choice (8 heads with 8 features each $\rightarrow 8\times8=64$) which is the setting reported by \citet{velickovic2018}. The original GCN paper used smaller hidden sizes for the small citation benchmarks (e.g., 16) \cite{kipf2017}; we intentionally increase the GCN output to 64 so that downstream SAE analyses receive embeddings of equal dimension across models (this is a common practice when comparing representational geometry across model families) \cite{kipf2017,pahng2024}.

\paragraph{GAT internals (hidden dimensions and heads).} We follow the original GAT architectural configuration of 8 attention heads with 8 features per head in the intermediate layers, as reported by \citet{velickovic2018}. The original GAT paper motivated this choice through extensive ablation studies on citation networks (Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed), demonstrating that multi-head attention with $K=8$ heads stabilizes the learning process and allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions in the graph. They found that using 8 features per head strikes an optimal balance between model expressivity and computational efficiency, while the multi-head mechanism provides implicit ensemble learning that improves robustness. For our second layer, this yields $8 \times 8 = 64$ total dimensions, matching our standardized bottleneck for SAE analysis. The original paper reported that increasing the number of heads beyond 8 provided diminishing returns, while fewer heads led to less stable training dynamics on graph-structured data.

\paragraph{Masking probability (\texttt{mask\_prob}).} We use \texttt{mask\_prob = 0.2}. Masked graph autoencoder work has shown that reconstruction performance and downstream transfer vary with mask ratio and that conservative masking ratios (e.g., $0.1$--$0.3$) are often a stable starting point for discriminative downstream tasks, while larger ratios may be workable but can degrade performance depending on redundancy in node features and graph homophily \cite{hou2022,maskgae2023}. We therefore choose 0.2 as a conservative masking rate that provides a meaningful reconstruction task while retaining sufficient observed context for stable SAE learning.

\paragraph{Optimizer, learning rate and training schedule.} We use Adam with a baseline learning rate \texttt{lr=1e-3} for the baseline comparison analysis. A learning rate of $10^{-3}$ is a common default in modern GNN work and appears frequently in both empirical GNN studies and GNN AutoML search ranges; it provides a stable baseline for comparisons across architectures (we report experiments with identical optimizer settings for all models). \cite{zhou2022automl,knyazev2019}.

\paragraph{Epochs and early stopping.} We train for up to \texttt{num\_epochs=100} with early stopping (validation patience $=25$). A 100-epoch budget combined with a moderate patience value offers sufficient time for convergence on the medium-scale benchmarks used in this study while avoiding overfitting; patience of 20--50 epochs is common in applied deep learning and has been used in recent GNN / autoencoder papers as a conservative stopping heuristic \cite{prechelt1998,hou2022}. We also save the best validation checkpoint and report metrics from that checkpoint.

\paragraph{Concat vs.\ final projection.} The choice to \texttt{concat=True} in intermediate attention layers (and \texttt{concat=False} in the final layer) follows the original GAT design: concatenation across heads increases representational capacity mid-network, whereas the final layer projects to logits without concatenation for stable classification outputs \cite{velickovic2018}. When comparing representations we keep this canonical behavior to ensure our GAT baseline mirrors the original design.

\paragraph{Practical notes and reproducibility.} For every reported experiment we (i) fix the random seeds, (ii) run each model across multiple seeds and report mean $\pm$ std, and (iii) provide a short config file in the supplementary material with the exact training script, optimizer state, and checkpointing procedure.

\subsection{Sparse Autoencoder Learning}

To decompose the GNN's internal representations, we trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) on the frozen 64-dimensional activations $h \in \mathbb{R}^{64}$ from the second hidden layer. Crucially, the SAEs were trained and validated using activations derived strictly from the same training and validation graphs used to train the GNN. The test graphs were reserved exclusively for inference and downstream interpretability analysis to ensure no data leakage occurred between the dictionary learning and evaluation phases.

The SAE architecture consists of a linear encoder, a sparsity constraint, and a linear decoder. The encoder maps the input to a high-dimensional latent space $z \in \mathbb{R}^L$ via an affine transformation followed by a ReLU activation:
\begin{equation}
z = \text{ReLU}(W_{\text{enc}} h + b_{\text{enc}})
\end{equation}
Sparsity is enforced via a "Top-K" mechanism, which retains only the $k$ largest activations and zeros out the rest, effectively setting the majority of the latent units to zero:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{z} = \text{TopK}(z, k)
\end{equation}
The decoder then reconstructs the input $\hat{h}$ from the sparse latent vector $\tilde{z}$:
\begin{equation}
\hat{h} = W_{\text{dec}} \tilde{z} + b_{\text{dec}}
\end{equation}
The model is optimized by minimizing the reconstruction error (Mean Squared Error) over the batch of $N$ node activations:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{SAE}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \| h_i - \hat{h}_i \|^2
\end{equation}

We performed a comprehensive hyperparameter sweep to identify the optimal configuration, varying the latent dimension $L \in \{128, 256, 512\}$ and the sparsity constraint $k \in \{4, 8, 16, 32\}$.

\subsubsection{Hyperparameter Selection via Point-Biserial Correlation}

The selection of the optimal SAE configuration was driven by the alignment between learned features and ground-truth biological motifs. We quantified this alignment using the point-biserial correlation coefficient ($r_{pb}$), which measures the relationship between a continuous variable (latent feature activation) and a binary variable (motif presence). For a given latent feature $z$ and a binary motif indicator $m$ (where $m=1$ if the node belongs to the motif and $0$ otherwise), $r_{pb}$ is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
r_{pb} = \frac{M_1 - M_0}{s_n} \sqrt{\frac{n_1 n_0}{n^2}}
\end{equation}
where $M_1$ and $M_0$ are the mean activations for nodes within and outside the motif, respectively; $n_1$ and $n_0$ are the counts of nodes in each group; $n$ is the total number of nodes; and $s_n$ is the standard deviation of the feature activation vector.

To ensure statistical rigor, we generated empirical null distributions for each feature-motif pair by running 1,000 permutations where motif labels were randomly shuffled (Algorithm \ref{alg:permutation}). P-values were computed empirically and corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR) procedure with $\alpha = 0.05$. 

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Null Distribution Permutation Testing}

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State \textbf{Input:} Latent activations $Z \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times L}$, Motif labels $M \in \{0,1\}^{N \times K}$
\State \textbf{Parameters:} $N_{perm} = 1000$

    \State Compute observed correlation $r_{obs} = \text{Corr}(Z_{:,j}, M_{:,k})$
    \State Initialize count $c = 0$
    \For{$p = 1$ to $N_{perm}$}
        \State Shuffle $M_{:,k}$ to obtain $M'_{:,k}$
        \State Compute null correlation $r_{null} = \text{Corr}(Z_{:,j}, M'_{:,k})$
        \If{$|r_{null}| \geq |r_{obs}|$}
            \State $c \leftarrow c + 1$
        \EndIf
    \EndFor
    \State Compute empirical p-value $p_{val} = c / N_{perm}$
\EndFor
\State Apply Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction to all $p_{val}$
\State \textbf{Return:} Significant feature-motif pairs
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The primary metric for model selection was the \textbf{Maximum Absolute Point-Biserial Correlation ($|r_{pb}|_{max}$)} achieved by any significant feature in the dictionary. This metric prioritizes models that discover at least one highly interpretable, disentangled feature representing a biological mechanism. Table \ref{tab:sae_sweeps} shows the results from the hyperparameter sweep. The configuration $(L=512, k=16)$ yielded the highest max $|r_{pb}|$ and was selected for downstream analysis.

\subsection{Causal Ablation Analysis}

To validate that the identified interpretable features are causally relevant to the GNN's predictions, we performed a three-way ablation analysis. The goal was to quantify the impact of specific latent features on the model's ability to correctly impute gene expression.

For a selected feature index $f$ identified as significant for a specific motif, we compared the GNN's performance under three conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Original:} Inference using the original, unmodified GNN activations $h$.
    \item \textbf{Full SAE:} Inference using the fully reconstructed activations $\hat{h} = D(E(h))$. This establishes a baseline for degradation caused by the autoencoder's compression.
    \item \textbf{Ablated SAE:} Inference using reconstructed activations where the specific feature $z_f$ is manually zeroed out in the latent space before decoding.
\end{enumerate}

The impact metric was defined as the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the GNN's predictions and the \textit{ground truth} expression values, computed specifically on the masked nodes (Algorithm \ref{alg:ablation}).

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Feature Ablation Impact Analysis}
\label{alg:ablation}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State \textbf{Input:} GNN model $\mathcal{G}$, SAE model $(E, D)$, Feature indices $F_{abl}$, Test Graphs $\mathcal{T}$
\State Initialize results list $R$
\For{each graph $G \in \mathcal{T}$}
    \State Get original activations $h = \text{GNN}_{enc}(G)$
    \State Get ground truth $y_{true}$ and mask $M$
    \State \textbf{1. Original Inference:}
    \State $\hat{y}_{orig} = \text{GNN}_{head}(h)$
    \State $L_{orig} = \text{MSE}(\hat{y}_{orig}[M], y_{true}[M])$
    \State \textbf{2. Full SAE Inference:}
    \State $\hat{h}_{full} = D(E(h))$
    \State $\hat{y}_{full} = \text{GNN}_{head}(\hat{h}_{full})$
    \State $L_{full} = \text{MSE}(\hat{y}_{full}[M], y_{true}[M])$
    \State \textbf{3. Ablated Inference:}
    \State $z = E(h)$
    \State $z[F_{abl}] \leftarrow 0$ \Comment{Zero out specific features}
    \State $\hat{h}_{abl} = D(z)$
    \State $\hat{y}_{abl} = \text{GNN}_{head}(\hat{h}_{abl})$
    \State $L_{abl} = \text{MSE}(\hat{y}_{abl}[M], y_{true}[M])$
    \State Store $(L_{orig}, L_{full}, L_{abl})$ in $R$
\EndFor
\State Perform Wilcoxon signed-rank tests between distributions of $L$
\State \textbf{Return:} Statistical significance and mean impact $\Delta = L_{abl} - L_{full}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

We define the \textbf{Ablation Impact} as $\Delta_{abl} = L_{abl} - L_{full}$. A statistically significant positive $\Delta_{abl}$ (verified via Wilcoxon signed-rank test) indicates that the ablated feature contained necessary information for the GNN's performance on that specific motif, confirming its causal role.


\section{Experimental Results}

We organize our results to trace the journey from raw graph learning to mechanistic understanding. First, we analyze the training dynamics and data characteristics to establish a robust baseline. Second, we evaluate the Sparse Autoencoder's ability to compress and reconstruct the GNN's latent space. Third, we map learned SAE features to specific biological motifs using statistical correlation. Finally, we verify the functional importance of these features through causal ablation.

\subsection{Data Characteristics and Model Training}

Before training, we verified the integrity of our synthetic dataset. The edge weights were distributed broadly (Figure \ref{fig:edge_dist}), ensuring that the GNN must learn to handle variable signal strengths rather than relying on binary adjacency. We employed the Optuna framework to systematically optimize the GNN hyperparameters. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:optuna_history}, the optimization process effectively explored the hyperparameter space, converging towards a stable region of low validation loss. The distribution of losses across trials (Figure \ref{fig:optuna_loss}) demonstrates that the selected configuration significantly outperforms the mean, confirming the value of the optimization step.

Based on this analysis, the final GCN model was trained with an optimal \textbf{Learning Rate of 0.017}, a \textbf{Batch Size of 128}, and a \textbf{Masking Probability of 0.2}. We trained for \textbf{100 epochs} with an early stopping patience of 25. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:training_loss}, the model achieved rapid convergence using these parameters, with the training and validation losses tracking closely. The final Test Loss stabilized at approximately $0.00377$, indicating that the model successfully generalized the propagation rules to unseen graphs without overfitting.

  \caption{Distribution of edge weights in the synthetic dataset. The variability in weights ensures that the learning task requires quantitative signal integration, not just topological connectivity.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Statistical Analysis of Baseline Comparisons}

  To validate that the observed performance differences between GNN models and baselines are statistically significant and practically meaningful, we
  conducted a multi-seed evaluation across $N=5$ random seeds. Table \ref{tab:statistical_comparison} summarizes the pairwise statistical tests for all four     
   comparisons of interest.

  \begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Pairwise statistical comparison of model performance across 5 random seeds. Bold indicates statistical significance at $\alpha \le 0.05$.}
    \label{tab:statistical_comparison}
    \begin{tabular}{lcccccc}
      \toprule
      \textbf{Comparison} & \textbf{Mean Diff} & \textbf{p-value} & \textbf{$r_{rb}$} & \textbf{95\% CI} & \textbf{Effect} & \textbf{Significant?} \\
      \midrule
      GCN vs. MLP & -0.0008 & \textbf{0.000002} & 1.00 & [1.0000, 1.0000] & Large & Yes \\
      GAT vs. MLP & -0.0001 & \textbf{0.0083} & 0.8286 & [0.6238, 0.9714] & Large & Yes \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
  \end{table}

  \paragraph{GNN vs. Graph-Agnostic MLP.}
  The comparison between GNNs and the MLP baseline isolates the contribution of graph structure. Both GCN and GAT significantly outperform the MLP (p =
  0.000002 for GCN vs MLP and p = 0.0083 for GAT vs MLP), with mean differences of -0.0008 and -0.0001 respectively. The large effect sizes ($r_{rb} \gg 0.75$) demonstrate that graph convolutions        
  provide substantial predictive advantage beyond node features alone. Graph attention works well but has close performance with MLP. However, p-values and effect sizes clearly indicate GAT working better over the runs across 20 seeds.    

  \paragraph{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals.}
  The 95\% bootstrap confidence intervals for all effect sizes exclude zero and remain well within the "large effect" range ($r_{rb} \geq 0.5$), indicating
  that the observed differences are robust and not artifacts of random seed selection. The very narrow intervals (e.g., [1.00, 1.00] for GCN vs. MLP)
   suggest stable performance across initialization and data split variability, node masking and dropout. The relatively wide intervals (e.g., [0.62, 0.97] for GAT vs. MLP)
   suggest performance being affected across the same stochastic training parameters (initialization, data split, node masking and dropout). However, p-value $\le 0.05$ and rank-biserial effect size ($\ge |0.5|$) clearly indicate GAT performing better than graph-agnostic MLP.

\paragraph{Performance Variance Across Seeds.}
To comprehensively assess model stability and reproducibility, we analyzed the variance of test set performance across 20 random seeds for GCN, GAT, and MLP models. Table \ref{tab:variance_summary} presents detailed statistical summaries including mean, median, standard deviation, interquartile range (IQR), and percentiles for each model. The analysis reveals that GCN exhibits the lowest variance and tightest distribution, indicating highly consistent performance across different initializations and data splits. GAT shows slightly higher variance but maintains stable performance, with the median test MSE closely tracking the mean. The MLP baseline demonstrates the highest variance, reflecting its sensitivity to initialization without the stabilizing effect of graph structure. The narrow standard deviations and IQRs for GCN and GAT validate that graph-based architectures not only achieve superior performance but also maintain consistent behavior across training runs, a critical property for reproducible machine learning research.

\subsection{Hyperparameter Optimization Results}

  \subsubsection{Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)}

  The GCN hyperparameter search converged after 50 trials using Optuna's TPE sampler, with the optimization history showing rapid initial improvement
  followed by stable convergence. The best configuration achieved a validation loss of 0.00356, with the following optimal hyperparameters: learning rate       
  $3.47 \times 10^{-3}$, hidden dimension (Layer 1) of 128, hidden dimension (Layer 2) of 64, dropout of 0.20, and batch size of 128.

  The optimization history demonstrates that the TPE sampler efficiently explored the hyperparameter space, with the majority of improvement occurring
  within the first 20 trials. The loss distribution across all trials shows a concentration of validation losses in the range [0.0035, 0.0045], with a long     
  tail extending to 0.012, indicating that certain hyperparameter combinations (particularly very small batch sizes and high dropout rates) led to
  substantially degraded performance.

  exploration of the hyperparameter space and concentration of well-performing configurations.}

  \label{fig:optuna_history}
  \end{figure}

  \subsubsection{Graph Attention Network (GAT)}

  The GAT architecture exhibited a more complex optimization landscape due to the larger hyperparameter space introduced by multi-head attention. After 50      
  trials, the best configuration achieved a validation loss of 0.0046, marginally higher than the GCN. The optimal hyperparameters were: learning rate
  $1.49 \times 10^{-2}$ (approximately 0.01487), Layer 1 with 2 heads $\times$ 32 channels = 64 dimensions, Layer 2 with 8 heads $\times$ 8 channels = 64       
  dimensions, dropout of 0.0, and batch size of 128.

  Figure \ref{fig:gat_optuna} shows the optimization history and loss distribution for the GAT hyperparameter sweep. The optimization trajectory exhibits       
  more variability in intermediate trials compared to the GCN, suggesting that the attention mechanism introduces sensitivity to the configuration of heads     
  and channels. The loss distribution shows a concentration in the range [0.0035, 0.0050], with several trials exploring suboptimal regions of the
  hyperparameter space before the TPE sampler converged on the optimal configuration.

  \begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{GAT Figures/loss_distribution.png}
    \caption{GAT hyperparameter optimization results from 20 Optuna trials. \textbf{(Left)} Optimization history showing validation loss progression, with

  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{GAT Figures/optimization_history.png}
  \caption{GAT hyperparameter optimization history using Optuna}
  \label{fig:optuna_history}
  \end{figure}

  Interestingly, the optimal GAT configuration uses a significantly higher learning rate ($1.49 \times 10^{-2}$) compared to the GCN ($3.47 \times
  10^{-3}$), suggesting that the attention mechanism benefits from more aggressive optimization steps. However, the optimal dropout was 0.0 for GAT versus
  0.20 for GCN, indicating that the attention mechanism may provide implicit regularization that reduces the need for explicit dropout.

\subsection{GNN Training Convergence}
We'll now dive into the training and convergence of the GCN and GAT trained from scratch on the optimal hyperparameters obtained from the previous graphs

\subsubsection{GCN Training and Convergence}

The training results indicated strong convergence and successful learning of propagation rules. The model was trained for 20 epochs, with validation occurring at every step. The training logs revealed a consistent decrease in loss, suggesting that the network successfully internalized the causal logic of the graphs.
    
      \begin{figure}[H]

      \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{training_progress.png}

      \label{fig:training_loss}
      \end{figure}
      \FloatBarrier


\subsubsection{Graph Attention Network (GAT) Training and Convergence}

After sweeping the GAT hyperparameters (varying head counts, hidden widths, and learning rates), we selected the configuration that minimized validation masked-MSE while producing stable SAE activations. The final architecture uses two attention heads of 32 dimensions in the first layer (projecting $2 \rightarrow 64$), eight heads of eight dimensions in the second layer (maintaining the 64-D bottleneck consumed by the SAE), and a single-head attention block for the final prediction; all attention blocks apply dropout $0.0$.

The learning-rate sweep identified \textbf{$1.48 \times 10^{-2}$ (i.e., $0.014874209528998391$) }as the best setting. Training uses Adam, batch size $128$, mask probability $0.2$, and a stratified $4{,}000/500/500$ split across motif classes. We run for $100$ epochs with patience of 25 epochs where the validation loss is no longer smaller than the current best validation lost. The following graph shows the early stop result:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{GAT Figures/gat_learning_curve_balanced.png}
  \caption{GAT learning curves (masked MSE on train/val/test splits) over 40 epochs (early stopped) for the balanced motif dataset on the optimal hyperparameters. Since the loss starts at a much lower value compared to the GCN, this is essentially a highly zoomed in version of the training curve focused at the potential convergence area. 
  From our previous experience facing instabilities with GAT training, we also plotted the test loss of the model at every epoch. Test loss is not used in }
  \label{fig:gat_learning_curve}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Sparse Autoencoder Optimization}

The interpretability of our findings hinges on the quality of the Sparse Autoencoder. We tracked the SAE's reconstruction loss and sparsity levels throughout the training process (Figure \ref{fig:sae_training}). The model quickly converged to a low reconstruction error while maintaining the target sparsity (approximately 3\% active neurons). The final metrics (Figure \ref{fig:sae_metrics}) confirm that the SAE achieves a reconstruction loss of $\approx 5.28 \times 10^{-7}$ on the test set, essentially preserving the information content of the GNN's 64-dimensional embedding while projecting it into a 512-dimensional sparse basis.

For the SAE trained on GCN activaions, the parameters that yielded the highest $r_{bp}$ value had latent dimension of 512 and k of 16, while for the SAE trained on GAT activations the optimal parameters had latent dimension of 256 with k value of 32.

\subsection{Discovering Motif-Specific Features}

The core hypothesis of this work is that GNNs learn "biological primitives." To test this, we analyzed the correlation between SAE features and ground-truth motifs. Figure \ref{fig:volcano} presents a Volcano Plot of all learned features. We observe a set of features with high statistical significance (high $-\log_{10}(p)$) and strong effect sizes (high $|r_{pb}|$), highlighted in colors corresponding to their specific motif associations.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{volcano_plot.png}
  \caption{Volcano Plot illustrating feature significance. Each point represents an SAE feature. Features that are significantly correlated (FDR $< 0.05$) with specific motifs are colored. The clear separation of these points from the null mass (bottom center) suggests the existence of "monosemantic" features specialized for tasks like Feedback Loops or Cascades.}
  \label{fig:volcano}
\end{figure}

This specificity is further visualized in the correlation distribution (Figure \ref{fig:corr_dist}). While most features have near-zero correlation (noise), a distinct tail of highly correlated features emerges. The precision-recall plot (right panel) demonstrates that for top-ranked features, the model achieves high precision, effectively acting as a motif detector.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{correlation_distribution_and_precision_recall.png}
  \caption{Left: Distribution of absolute Point-Biserial correlations. The long tail indicates a subset of features strongly driven by motif presence. Right: Precision-Recall curve for feature detection, showing that the most active features are highly reliable indicators of their respective motifs.}
  \label{fig:corr_dist}
\end{figure}

The "monosemanticity" of these features is starkly visible in the heatmap of significant correlations (Figure \ref{fig:heatmap}). The matrix is sparse and structured; features that activate for Feedback Loops (e.g., $z496$, $z236$) rarely activate for Cascades or Single-Input Modules. This orthogonality implies that the GNN has disentangled the disparate computational logic required for cyclic vs. linear information flow. Interestingly, certain features such as $z496$ appear to play dual roles: $z496$ is strongly positively correlated with Feedback Loops but strongly negatively correlated with Single-Input Modules (blue in the heatmap), suggesting it may act as a discriminator between these two topologies.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{feature_motif_correlation_heatmap_significant.png}
  \caption{Heatmap of significant feature-motif correlations. The distinct blocks of color indicate that different subsets of the SAE dictionary are dedicated to processing different graph topologies, providing strong evidence for disentangled internal representations. Note the strong positive correlations (red) for Feedback Loops and negative correlations (blue) for Single-Input Modules for specific features like $z496$.}
  \label{fig:heatmap}
\end{figure}

We confirmed these associations are non-random using permutation testing. Figure \ref{fig:null_dist} shows that the observed correlations for top features like $z496$ (Feedback Loop) and $z236$ (SIM) lie far outside the empirical null distributions. Figure \ref{fig:top_features} ranks these top features, providing a concrete "dictionary" of the GNN's internal language.

\subsection{Causal Verification of Learned Circuits}

Correlation allows us to generate hypotheses about feature meaning; ablation allows us to verify them. We zeroed out the motif-specific features identified above and measured the impact on the GNN's prediction , where error is defined as $$MSE_{ablation \ impact} = MSE_{reconstructed \ loss} - MSE_{ablated \ reconstructed \ loss}$$ We removed all features deemed as interpretable through significant FDR (FDR < 0.05) after permutation testing and ablated all interpretable features in a per motif fashion. Then we ablated the same number of random non-significant features through 100 trials to see whether the $MSE_{ablation \ impact}$ is truly different than random. Each graph was given a "dominant" motif type representing the motif that is most present in each graph.  As shown in Figure \ref{fig:ablation}, ablating the identified "interpretable" features (colored bars) caused a statistically significant spike in Mean Squared Error compared to ablating random control features (gray bars) for Feedback Loops. Specifically, removing the top 39 features for Feedback Loops degraded performance drastically for feedback loop motifs while not a drastic result for others, suggesting our GNN has identified motif specific activations related to feedback loop graphical structures.

Interestingly, for Single-Input Modules (SIM), the ablation of motif-associated features resulted in a negative mean ablation impact (error decrease), whereas random controls remained near zero. This counter-intuitive result, combined with the strong negative correlations observed in the heatmap (Figure \ref{fig:heatmap}), suggests that the features identified for SIMs may be suppressive or inhibitory in nature. Removing them may simplify the network's processing for this specific synthetic task, or indicate that the network uses these features to "rule out" other complex topologies (like feedback loops) rather than to directly compute the SIM dynamics.

For Feedback Loops (orange), ablating specific features causes a large increase in error, confirming their causal necessity. For Single-Input Modules (green), the ablation impact is negative, aligning with the negative correlations observed in Figure \ref{fig:heatmap} and suggesting an inhibitory role.}

Figure \ref{fig:control_dist} further contextualizes this result, showing that the impact of the targeted ablations (red dashed lines) consistently falls in the extreme tails of the random control distributions.

\subsection{Comparison with Graph Attention Networks (GAT)}

We expanded our analysis to Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to determine if the learnability of biological motifs is architecture-dependent. The GAT model, trained with 4 attention heads, exhibited a distinct training profile compared to the GCN. As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:gat_learning_curve}, the validation loss showed significant oscillatory behavior in the early epochs, contrasting with the monotonic convergence of the GCN. This instability likely arises from the attention mechanism's attempt to learn dynamic edge weights in a synthetic environment where edge weights are fixed and deterministic. However, despite this volatility, the model converged to a final test loss comparable to the GCN.

To probe the internal representations, we trained an SAE on the GAT's second-layer activations. The resulting feature-motif correlation heatmap (Figure \ref{fig:gat_heatmap}) displays the same characteristic block-diagonal structure observed in the GCN. Distinct features (e.g., $z_{128}$, $z_{170}$) emerged that correlated strongly and exclusively with specific motifs. This confirms that the emergence of "motif-detecting" latent features is a robust property of the learning task itself, rather than an artifact of the graph convolution operator.

To move beyond correlation and establish causality, we performed ablation studies. We identified the sets of features most strongly correlated with each motif and "ablated" them (forced their values to zero) during inference. We then measured the resulting increase in Mean Squared Error (MSE) compared to a baseline of ablating an equivalent number of randomly selected active features.

  \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{feature_motif_correlation_heatmap_dim256_k32_significant.png}
  \caption{Heatmap of significant feature-motif correlations for the GAT model. Similar to the GCN, the GAT learns disentangled representations, with specific SAE latent features (rows) correlating strongly with specific motif types (columns). The block structure confirms that "monosemanticity" is a robust property of GNNs trained on this task, regardless of the specific aggregation mechanism.}
  \label{fig:gat_heatmap}
\end{figure}

To move beyond correlation and establish causality, we performed ablation studies. We identified the sets of features most strongly correlated with each motif and "ablated" them (forced their values to zero) during inference. We then measured the resulting increase in Mean Squared Error (MSE) compared to a baseline of ablating an equivalent number of randomly selected active features.
The mean ablation impact is shown in Figures \ref{fig:interpretability_bars1} and \ref{fig:interpretability_bars2}. For the Cascade and Feedforward Loop motifs (Figure \ref{fig:interpretability_bars1}), removing the specific motif-correlated features caused a statistically significant drop in performance (increase in MSE) compared to the random controls. This indicates that these features are functionally necessary for the model's predictions on those subgraphs. The effect is even more pronounced for Feedback Loops (Figure \ref{fig:interpretability_bars2}), where the targeted ablation resulted in a dramatic increase in error. This suggests that the cyclic dynamics of feedback loops require precise, dedicated feature representations that the model relies on heavily.
We further validated the statistical significance of these findings by comparing the targeted ablations against the full distribution of random ablations, as shown in the random control histograms (Figures \ref{fig:random_controls_all1} and \ref{fig:random_controls_all2}). In these plots, the blue and red dashed lines represent the mean impact of ablating the specific feature sets for each motif, while the light histograms show the distribution of impacts from hundreds of random feature subsets. In almost all cases, the impact of the motif-specific ablation falls in the extreme tail or completely outside the random distribution. This visual separation provides strong evidence that the identified features are not just "average" latent variables but are uniquely specialized components of the GAT's computational circuit for processing biological network motifs.

\section{Discussion}

The results presented here provide the first concrete evidence that Graph Neural Networks, when trained on biological tasks, spontaneously organize their internal latent spaces to align with known biological motifs. This finding bridges the gap between the "black box" predictive power of deep learning and the mechanistic understanding required in systems biology.

\textbf{Interpretation of Disentangled Representations:} The success of the Sparse Autoencoder in isolating motif-specific features—such as $z496$ for Feedback Loops—suggests that the GNN is not merely learning a diffuse, distributed representation of the graph. Instead, it appears to be learning composable "subroutines" or "circuits." The orthogonality observed in the correlation heatmap indicates that the network processes cyclic feedback logic differently from linear cascade logic. This aligns with the biological reality that these motifs perform fundamentally different signal processing tasks (e.g., oscillation/homeostasis vs. signal amplification).

\textbf{Comparison of Architectures:} Our comparison between GCN and GAT architectures reveals that interpretability is not unique to a specific model type. Both architectures yielded to SAE decomposition, revealing that the "motif-finding" capability is likely a property of the task and the learning process itself, rather than the specific aggregation mechanism. While GATs offer dynamic weighting, this did not translate to better performance or more distinct features for these synthetic motifs, suggesting that for defined regulatory logic, the simpler GCN architecture is both sufficient and robust.

\textbf{Implications for Biological Discovery:} The ability to map latent features back to graph topology offers a powerful new tool for network biology. Currently, motif discovery is a computationally expensive combinatorial problem. Our approach suggests that a trained GNN could act as a heuristic "motif scanner," where high activation of specific latent features flags the presence of complex regulatory structures in large, noisy, real-world networks. If a feature $z_i$ consistently activates for a known Feedforward Loop, its activation in an unannotated part of a GRN could generate a high-confidence hypothesis for experimental validation.

\textbf{Causal Necessity:} Our ablation studies go beyond simple correlation. By demonstrating that removing these specific features destroys the model's ability to predict expression dynamics within specific motifs (most notably Feedback Loops), we establish a causal link. The GNN \textit{must} use these specific features to solve the task. This is a critical step towards trust in AI-driven biology; we can now say not only \textit{that} the model works, but \textit{which parts} of the model are responsible for understanding specific biological phenomena. The inverse effect seen in SIMs (where ablation improved performance) opens new questions about the role of inhibitory features in neural network representations of simple topologies.

\textbf{Limitations:} While promising, this study relies on synthetic data governed by discrete-time iterative update rule. Real gene regulatory networks involve stochasticity, non-linearities, and hidden variables (e.g., protein degradation rates) not captured here. Furthermore, biological motifs rarely exist in isolation; they are embedded in dense, overlapping networks. While our mixed-motif dataset provides a preliminary test of disentanglement, scaling this to whole-cell regulatory maps remains a challenge.

\section{Conclusion}

This work demonstrates that mechanistic interpretability techniques, originally developed for language models, can be effective in the domain of graph learning. By applying Sparse Autoencoders to GNNs trained on synthetic graph strutures with particular motifs and fixed size, we successfully recovered latent spaces that slightly correlate based on specific motifs, particularly feedback loops (FBL) and single-input modules (SIM). We validated these features causally with ablation tests which showcase high mean ablation impact for the highly correlated motifs (SIM and FBL) as ablation results lie far beyond the clustered region for the FBL and SIM, indicating that is not random occurence.

A key architectural finding is that GCNs exhibit substantially stronger monosemantic structure than GATs. While GAT-based SAEs recover statistically significant motif-correlated features, their ablation produces nearly uniform changes in MSE across all motif types, indicating that GAT representations are comparatively more distributed and less causally localized. In contrast, the GCN demonstrates true motif-specific circuit localization, with Feedback Loop feature ablations selectively degrading performance only on Feedback Loop graphs. This distinction shows that attention mechanisms, while expressive, may blur mechanistic circuit boundaries under fixed regulatory dynamics, whereas message-passing via GCNs more cleanly isolates recurrent regulatory computation.

Together, these results demonstrate that mechanistic interpretability is not merely a statistical artifact of correlation heatmaps, but a causal property of how certain graph architectures solve biological regulatory tasks.
